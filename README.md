## Task

This project was made as a part of the Web design course at Brno University of Technology, Faculty of information technology. 
The task was to create a cascading style sheet, which will modify given  `index.html` file. We were not allowed to modify directly this file, so I am not author of any part of the file. You can find the solution in `css/style.css`. The targeted appearance was specified by `goal.png`. For more information you can visit the [web page](https://www.fit.vut.cz/study/course/ITW/.en) of the whole course.
